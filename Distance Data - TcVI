Table. Estimates of Evolutionary Divergence between Sequences
The number of base substitutions per site from between sequences are shown. Analyses were conducted using the Maximum Composite Likelihood model [1]. This analysis involved 3 nucleotide sequences. All ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair (pairwise deletion option). There were a total of 2951016 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA11 [2][3]
